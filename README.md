# SimpleCalculatorRobot
A proof of concept project demonstrating a new way of controlling the robot. Instead of the command scheduler running everything, there are three main pieces of the code: Operator input, subsystem output, and a central set of system control values. Operator input runs on a slower loop, and sets the system control values to match the inputs. The subsystems run on a much faster loop, and adjust their behavior according the the system control values. This is not super helpful for simple tasks, but it allows much faster loops for more complicated controllers, such as PID.
